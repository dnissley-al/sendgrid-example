Generate an api key with your sengrid account and run the following commands:

echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env

Note: Sending to homeadvisor email addresses doesn't seem to work. Probably best to send to your personal gmail, etc.
